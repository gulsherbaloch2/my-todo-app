# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x, Python 3.9+
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 16+ (App Router), FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon PostgreSQL, Better Auth
**Storage**: Neon PostgreSQL database with SQLModel ORM
**Testing**: Jest/React Testing Library for frontend, pytest for backend
**Target Platform**: Web application (responsive, cross-browser)
**Project Type**: Full-stack web application with separate frontend/backend
**Performance Goals**: Page load times under 3 seconds on 3G, API response times under 500ms
**Constraints**: WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance, responsive design, JWT authentication
**Scale/Scope**: Individual user focus with potential for scaling to 10k+ users

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
